  <h3>Early History :</h3>
  <img src="https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2018-04/AT_26ada4f6-aimage_story.jpg" alt="OldKuwait" class="center">
  <p>
    In 1613, the town of Kuwait was founded in
    modern-day Kuwait City. Administratively, it
    was a sheikhdom, ruled by local sheikhs.
    In 1716, the Bani Utub settled in Kuwait,
    which at this time was inhabited by a few
    fishermen and primarily functioned as a fishing village.
    In the eighteenth century, Kuwait prospered and rapidly
    became the principal commercial center for the transit
    of goods between India, Muscat, Baghdad and Arabia.
    By the mid 1700s, Kuwait had already established itself
    as the major trading route from the Persian Gulf to Aleppo.
    During the Persian siege of Basra in 1775â€“79, Iraqi merchants
    took refuge in Kuwait and were partly instrumental in the expansion
    of Kuwait's boat-building and trading activities. As a result,
    Kuwait's maritime commerce boomed, as the Indian trade routes with
    Baghdad, Aleppo, Smyrna and Constantinople were diverted to Kuwait
    during this time. The East India Company was diverted to
    Kuwait in 1792. The East India Company secured the sea
    routes between Kuwait, India and the east coasts of Africa.
    After the Persians withdrew from Basra in 1779, Kuwait continued
    to attract trade away from Basra.

  <p>
    The Constitution of Kuwait is
    considered a liberal constitution in the GCC.
    It guarantees a wide range of civil liberties
    and rights. In contrast to other states in the
    region, the political process largely respects
    constitutional provisions. Kuwait has a robust
    public sphere and active civil society with
    political and social organizations that are
    parties in all but name. Professional
    groups like the Chamber of Commerce maintain their
    autonomy from the government.
