      long and 800 meters wide (area about 0.75 km²). The distance
      between it and Failaka Island, which lies to the south,
      is approximately 3.2 kilometers. The distance between
      Miskan and the nearest part of mainland Kuwait is about

      save a lighthouse managed by Ibrahem Bu-Rashid who lived in the
      island along with his family to guide ships sailing in the Arabian
      Gulf at night. This island is important because it is a link in a
      chain of islands along Kuwait's coastline from north to south, which
      provide Kuwait with a defensive frontline.
